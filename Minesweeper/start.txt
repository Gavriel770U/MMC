Did you enjoy defusing the bomb? This is your next challenge.

Open the minesweeper executable in IDA. Do some research and learn how the game works.

Can you find how minesweeper represents different block states? (empty, mine, exposed, covered etc)

The password is: MMC{0x[],0x[],0x[],0x[]}
sorted by this order: mine(before explosion), flag, 2, 4

Some more interesting ideas to research: Explain how come the first click of a game never falls on a mine. How does minesweeper lay out the board in a way that such a case does not occur? Can you hack the game to complete the expert level in one second?

Good luck!
